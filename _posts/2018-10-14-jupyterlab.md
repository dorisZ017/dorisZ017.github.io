Recently I have been working on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction), which, of course is not my first Kaggle experience. As how I did before, I code in Python. What makes this time different is that I start to use a different environment than before, which is a brand-new experience and boosting my working efficiency. (I'm not referring to the _boosting algorithm_ in machine learning ;p). This powerful environment is called [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Sounds familiar? I know the name just reminds you of Jupyter Notebook! For many people working with data, Jupyter Notebook is a must-have tool, which is so widely used. [Kaggle kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) also mimics the how users code in Jupyter Notebook.

But did you, or are you suffering from the trouble of scrolling up and down through a long, long Notebook with countless cells just to check one of the outputs and end up losing where you were? You are not alone! The tedious interaction with long Notebook has been one of the obstacles between me and a Kaggle Medal, until I came across JupyterLab, which solves my problems to a large extent and greatly enhanced my experience.

There are tons of documentations and tutorials out there explaining how JupyterLab makes you work more efficiently and more happily. Here I just add one more point: on Mac OS, the font of code in Jupyter Notebook is Courier, and I HATE coding in Courier. As a Mac user I have tried several ways to work around the issue but none of them works as perfectly as JupyterLab did! I simply feel much happier than before!

Interested? Pleas go check it out and experience it and you will not be disappointed.
